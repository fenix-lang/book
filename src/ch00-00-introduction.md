**Mun** is a programming language aimed at rapid iteration development. Mun's
primary design goals are:

- Live reloading of code for extremely rapid iteration cycles.
- Statically typed to reduce the number of programming errors that surface
  at runtime.
- Ahead-of-time compiled to catch errors as early as possible and be able to
  optimize the code for target processors.
- Tight integration with IDEs to empower developers.
